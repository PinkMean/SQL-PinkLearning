SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a programming language primarily used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

I will start with the basics, where you can easily understand the step-by-step process. First, you need to install SQL Management Studio and Server. Then, we will create a database. My first sample is the database named ‘Analyst Salary,’ where I list different analyst salaries. There’s a disclaimer for the salary amount as they vary. Now, let’s start.
